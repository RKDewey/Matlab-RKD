This GitHub repository is my collection of priviate Matlab (Mathworks) scripts and functions.
I am an Oceanographer and have spent my career analyzing data.
I started writing Matlab code in 1993, first migrating many of my Fortran subroutines into m functions.
I gradually stopped using Fortran and have sued Matlab exclusively since about 1997.
This collection has many very useful routines for Oceanography.
I have also taught courses in Time Series Analysis, for example, and used Matlab to teach topics such as spetral analaysis, 
so my PS.m (Power Spectrum and Coherence) routine explicitly goes through each processing set to segment, window, and FFT the data.
As i retire, I will try to write a table of contents with desscriptions of the more valuale fucntions.
